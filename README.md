Primary purpose is to have a course planning forecasting tool

He wants to be able to look at current students by category, courses they have taken, and be able to forecast off of that what their course needs are going forward 

Example: If he can look at 3 major options. All require 4 core classes. What makes options unique is that when they get into upper level electives they have to choose different classes

### He wants:
- [x] to look at majors by specialization and look at where they are in order to see where they are. 
- [x] to ditch paper
- [x] it by major and minor
- [ ] to cross-reference the info for the forecasting tool
- [ ] to see how many people have completed each course
- [ ] to see how many people have completed each course
- [ ] to be able to browse by course and see which students have completed said course
- [x] to be able to browse by major, minor, course, student, year, currently enrolled (self-updating year?)
- [ ] to be able to search, update, remove, delete, enter new info, sort, add new Sort by major, minor, year, a-z

### Majors:
- News Media
- Multimedia
- Public Relations
- Undecided

### Minors:
- Print media
- Broadcast media
- Public relations
- Multimedia

We can create logins for individual students to track their surveys 

How many of each major does he have 

Possibly assign colors for each major?? 

Course list will go vertically and columns will show status of courses, taken, not taken, or currently enrolled 

One more thing.. In majors, the curriculum changed 2 years ago into 3 options, so there will be a few people who listed as just journalism (JRN) so there is a 4th major
